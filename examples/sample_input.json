        "narrative": "The authors present a case of a 60-year-old male chronic alcoholic diagnosed with amoebic liver abscess. He presented to the emergency department with fever, abdominal pain, and yellowish discoloration of urine for 10 days. Initial investigations revealed leukocytosis, deranged liver and renal function tests, and ultrasonography confirmed a large liver abscess. He was treated with intravenous metronidazole 2 gram/day in divided doses and underwent ultrasound-guided liver abscess aspiration. After one month of metronidazole therapy, with a cumulative dose of 60 grams, he developed sudden onset of acute ataxia and dysarthria. A subsequent CNS examination showed impaired coordination, positive past-pointing and finger-nose tests, scanning speech, and severe ataxia, rendering him unable to walk unassisted. Routine blood tests, CSF examination, Vitamin B12, and thyroid function tests were normal. An MRI of the brain revealed bilateral symmetrical hyperintense signals on FLAIR and T2W images and restriction on DWI in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum, consistent with metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity. Metronidazole was immediately discontinued, leading to considerable improvement in his gait and speech. He was able to walk independently after 5 days and reported no complaints in walking or speech after 10 days of follow-up. The authors concluded that metronidazole-induced neurotoxicity should be considered in patients presenting with cerebellar features after prolonged metronidazole therapy, emphasizing the importance of prompt MRI for diagnosis and immediate drug discontinuation for reversibility.",

Upon discontinuation of metronidazole, there was considerable improvement in gait and speech, with the patient able to walk independently after 5 days and reporting no complaints after 10 days. This strong temporal relationship, the characteristic MRI findings, and the positive dechallenge strongly suggest causality. Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole derivative with broad-spectrum cidal activity against protozoa and anaerobic bacteria. It is known to easily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and can accumulate, leading to CNS toxicity, including cerebellar dysfunction, especially with prolonged use or accumulation in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum. The authors themselves assessed causality as 'probable' (Naranjo score 7). A conservative approach prioritizes reporting this as a suspect drug due to the clear temporal association, known adverse effect profile, and positive dechallenge. Drug causality: Probable."
